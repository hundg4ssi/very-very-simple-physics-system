a very simple "physics" system

not really a physics system, more like a simple math projects, for newcomers to C++
if people who are new to C++ or don't know math or don't know where to search for an explanation,
here it is :)

it's basically a bouncing ball. just with a bad collision system.
the collision just checks if the ball's coordinates are lower than the wall of the window.

a graphics.h project.

I made this a bit of time ago,
also I think it's kinda bad if you are new to C++ and have to deal with large projects like other C++ "simple" physics systems
with 10 files and 400 lines of code.

only for educational purposes, it will hopefully give you a simple understanding.
also this is very un-clean code.
